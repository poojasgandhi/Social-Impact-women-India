# Social_Impact_women_India
This repository encompasses my submission for the WIDS (Women In Data Science) Challenge for 2018, held in Jan-Mar'18. It was an invite only competition based on InterMedia Survey Institute, a grant recipient of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates foundation in their Financial Services for the Poor program.  

Participants were required to predict gender based on demographic and behavioral information of survey respondents from India and their usage of traditional financial and mobile financial services. 

By predicting gender, idea was to explore the key differences in behavior patterns of men and women, and how that may impact their use of new financial services. Ideally, these findings would influence plans to reach women in developing economies and encourage them to adopt new financial tools that would help to lift them and their families out of poverty.
